**links will be ignnored please upload icon/image**

**Again read main rules, Also I will point out low quality images of products will be ignored, if you can not be bothered to search and find a better image we wont either**

**off-type icons will not be accepted, Home Assistant makes it visible when an entity is on or off, it is useless to weigh down the library**
